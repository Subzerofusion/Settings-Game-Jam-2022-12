Its just a plain ol godot project, the entry point should be `SplashScreen.tscn`
It should work in full screen

Remaining work:
- Title screen needs to be clear
- Tutorial needs to have controls and motivation
- Score card when complete

Stretch Goals:
- Onslaught mode, unlock the spawn rate and go ham for 30 seconds

Known bugs:
- Borders of game world can be seen
- Lights arent shown in tutorial splash
