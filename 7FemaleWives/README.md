In WftWGtQftSFW, you embark on a quest to enact your revenge on those who have ridiculed you for your quest to find your seventh female wife.
To do so, you use the power to control the wind that the Wind God granted you, and set sail to murder the non-believers using the giant sword the Wind God also attached to your ship.
- Use A/W to change the wind direction.
- Press Tab/M to open the map.
- Press 1/2/3 to change zoom level (Default: 2)
- Press E for a Wives update.
- Press Space/Esc to pause/unpause
- Press H to cheat and get a random power-up

After killing 10 enemies, a boss will spawn on the map, go kill it to find your seventh female wife. After this return home to Coney Island and wait for a message from the Wind God.

Do what the Wind god asked you to to finish the game.

## Dev Notes:
The wind mechanic sucks, the enemies are bad, it's almost impossible to die.
The random world generation is cool though, all of the textures except the wifes portraits and instagram are hand drawn.
